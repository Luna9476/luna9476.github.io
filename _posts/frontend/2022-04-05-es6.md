## Loops

1. while
2. do/while
3. for
4. for/of work with **iterable** objects
   
   Introduced in ES6.

    For/of with arrays, strings, sets
   ```javascript
   let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sum = 0;
   for (let element of data) {
       sum += element
   }
   ```

   For/of with objects.
   
   Objects are not by default iterable. Script below will throw an error:
   ```javascript
   let o = {x : 1, y: 2, z: 3}
   for (let element of o) {
       console.log(element)
   }
   ```
   However we can use for/of to loop through object.keys(), object.values(), object.entries():
   ```javascript
   let pairs = "";
   for (let [k, v] of Object.entries(o)) {
       pairs += k + v;
   }
   ```

  
   
5.  for/in
   
    It has some tricky results. For example:

    a is an array, i will be the index instead of the elements in a as expect.
    ```javascript
    for (let i in a) {
       console.log(i);
    }
    ```

## Asynchronous
