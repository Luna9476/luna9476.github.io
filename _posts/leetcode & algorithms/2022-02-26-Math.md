## [50. Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., $x^n$).

The simplest way is to multiply n times, time complexity is $O(n)$

Another way is to think $x^{10}$ as $x^5 * x ^5$ ï¼Œ then divide $x^5$ as $x^2 * x^3$ until $x^0$

```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        def helper(x: float, n: int):
            if x == 0:
                return 0
            if n == 0:
                return 1
            half = helper(x, n //2)
            if n % 2 == 0:
                return half * half
            else:
                return half * half * x
        
        res = helper(x, n)
        return res if n >= 0 else 1/res
```

## [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has.

n & (n-1) will change the n's last 1 to 0 

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n != 0:
            res += 1
            n &= n-1
        return res
```

## [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

For a base-10 case:
```python
ans = ans * 10 + n % 10
n /= 10
```

For a base-2 case, it's similar:
```python
ans = ans * 2 + n % 2
n /= 2
```
However we cannot do this, because it will ignore the zeros which are in the front of the base-2 number, like *00000010100101000001111010011100*. (In the base-10 case, it will not happen, since there would not be a number like 00089)

Also, for Java case, there is no unsigned int in java, so the number might be *1111111111...1*, which is a negative number, we should use bit manipulation to handle the negative number.

- How to get the last number of n?  => n & 1
- How to get the ans? => ans << 1 | n & 1 ( which is the same as ans * 2 + n % 2)

Then the answer would be:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(32): # we are sure that we need to handle 32 bits
            res = (n & 1) | res << 1
            n >>= 1
        return res
```
