## [50. Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., $x^n$).

The simplest way is to multiply n times, time complexity is $O(n)$

Another way is to think $x^{10}$ as $x^5 * x ^5$ ï¼Œ then divide $x^5$ as $x^2 * x^3$ until $x^0$

```python
```
