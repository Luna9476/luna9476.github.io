Prefix-sum can solve many sub-array sum problems. We can maintain the sum of array[0:i] to solve this kind of problems.

## What is Prefix-Sum?

preSum[i] is the sum of nums[0:i-1]. If we want the sum of nums[i:j+1], we can use presum[j+1]-prefix[i]
## Sample Problems in Leetcode

### 560. [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose **sum** equals to k.\\
> Example 1:\\
> Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2\\
> Output: 2\\
> Example 2:\\
> Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3\\
> Output: 2

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        dict_t = {}
        curr_sum = 0
        res = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            curr_sum += nums[i]
            ## from 0 to i
            if curr_sum == k:
                res += 1
            
            ## from where sum = curr_sum - k to i
            if curr_sum - k in dict_t.keys():
                res += dict_t.get(curr_sum - k)
            
            ## one more i having curr_sum
            if curr_sum not in dict_t.keys():
                dict_t[curr_sum] = 1
            else:
                dict_t[curr_sum] += 1
        
        return res
```

### 523. [ Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/)
>Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if nums has a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of k, or false otherwise.

> An integer x is a multiple of k if there exists an integer n such that x = n * k. 0 is always a multiple of k.

>Example 1:\\
>Input: nums = [23,2,4,6,7], k = 6\\
>Output: true\\
>Explanation: [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.

>Example 2:\\
>Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 13\\
>Output: false

Here we see the **"subarray sum"** again, so we consider use prefix-sum.

How can the (sum_subarray1 - sum_subarray2) % k == 0? Iff there remainings while divide by k are the same!

Another corner case we need to consider is the for 0s, they can be divided by any k.

```python
class Solution:
    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        dict_t = {}
        curr_sum = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            curr_sum += nums[i]
            
            remaining = curr_sum % k
            
            if i >= 1 and remaining == 0:
                return True
            
            if remaining in dict_t.keys() and i - dict_t.get(remaining) > 1:
                return True
                
            # here we only store the index which is the smallest among those who have the same remaining
            if remaining not in dict_t.keys():
                dict_t[remaining] = i
        
        return False
```

### 238. [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

>Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]\
>You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

This is a problem of subarray product, however it's similar to the sum problem.\
$res[i] = product[0:i] * product[i+1:len(nums)]$
