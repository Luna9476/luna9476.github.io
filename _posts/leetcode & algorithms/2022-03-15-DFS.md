## Graph DFS
### [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

We can use dfs to solve this problem:
- for all nodes in matrix:
  - If not visited, dfs
    - set it as visited
    - go through 4 directions, if the (x, y) are valid, do dfs()
  - count += 1

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        self.dirs = [[0,1], [1,0],[-1,0], [0,-1]]
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] != '0':
                    self.dfs(grid, i, j)
                    res += 1
        return res
                
    
    def dfs(self, grid: List[List[str]], row: int, col: int):
        grid[row][col] = '0'
        for direction in self.dirs:
            x = row + direction[0]
            y = col + direction[1]
            if  0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and grid[x][y] == '1':
                self.dfs(grid, x, y)
        
```
